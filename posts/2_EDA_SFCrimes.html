        <p class="paragraph">  
            Being born and raised in the Bay Area, San Francisco has always been a city close to my heart. Its rich Asian American history, dreamlike landscape, and soulwarming food culture has cemented SF's place in my 
            romanticization of the Golden City. As a hub of tech innovation in the Silicon Valley, home to leading tech giants and ambitious startups, all looking to recruit new talent (especially in AI and machine learning), 
            it's very likely that my career will one day bring me back home to the Bay.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But like many major metroplitan cities, San Francisco struggles with deeply-rooted social and economic challenges. Gentrification, wealth disparity, drug abuse, homelessness, and persistent petty crime cast 
            a shadow over the city, evoking comparisions to dystopian megacities in science fiction. In this post, I focus on one particular issue: crime and theft. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Though my analysis of police incident reports, I highlight several key insights: that <strong>crime as a yearly trend is decreasing</strong>, the <strong>frequency of incidents increases drastically at several times in the day</strong>, 
            <strong>thefts are the most common type of offense</strong>, and the <strong>distribution of thefts overall are largely concentrated in several key neighborhoods</strong>. You can find my full analysis in <a href="https://github.com/rogerwng/SFPD_Crime/blob/main/EDA.ipynb">this notebook.</a>
        </p>

        <p class="heading">Introducing the Dataset</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            San Francisco provides numerous datasets through the <a href="https://datasf.org/opendata/">DataSF initiative</a>, which seeks to support the residents, businesses, and visitors in the city through accessibility to data. The particular dataset I am using is 
            the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data">Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present.</a> 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This dataset has over <strong>900k rows and 35 columns</strong>, where each row represents a police incident report. Columns describe valuable information about each record, such as its date, time, location, category, and description. 
            Example categories of incidents include: larceny theft, assaults, and traffic arrests. A critical step in my exploratory data analysis (EDA) is standardizing and consolidating these categories into 
            more meaningful labels - a process that I'll discuss shortly.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            A full description of the columns and dataset can be found on DataSF's page. Here is a short snippet:
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Screenshot of DataSF's page describing dataset" src="../imgs/2/dataset_ex_desc.png">

        </div>

        <p class="heading">Clean Up the <strike>Streets</strike> Data</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Before diving into the EDA, the first step is always data cleaning. This section outlines my cleaning pipeline, including missing values, transforming date/time, and unifying incident categories.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Dropping Columns and Missing Values</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I started with dropping columns that were either redundant or unrelated to the analysis, such as administrative details. Next I addressed missing values. Several variables in this dataset had a large proportion of NaN values. 
            These, along with the irrelevant columns, were removed from the dataset. A short description of these columns is shown below:
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Description of dropped columns" src="../imgs/2/drop_col_desc.png">
            <p>Figure 2. A quick look at the columns dropped from the dataset.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            After this step, some missing values remained which were all connected to location-related variables. Although a variety of techniques are available to impute missing information, I chose instead to drop these rows. 
            This decision was motivated by the nature of my analysis. I wanted to highlight key neighborhoods where crimes occured, and did not want to bloat my figures with predicted or imputed datapoints. Subsequently, the 
            <strong>dataset size was cut</strong> from about <strong>936k to 868k.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Date and Time Transformation</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Next, I transformed the original date and time information into numerical and continous variables. Having a continouous variable for time will be extremeley helpful to plot datapoints as well as later apply machine learning models. 
            Thus, the original <em>'Incident Time'</em> column, which is in format (hr:min), is transformed into a new <em>'time'</em> column which is a continous value in the range [0,24). 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Then, from the <em>'Incident Date'</em> column, which is in format (year/month/day), the month is extracted into both discrete <em>'month'</em> and continuous <em>'month_cont'</em> variables. After these transformations, the remaining date and 
            time variables in the dataset take this form:
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Example rows from dataset showing time variables after transformation" src="../imgs/2/time_cols_after_trans.png">
            <p>Figure 3. Structure of time variables after transformation.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Unifying Categories into Major Incidents</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The <em>'Incident Category'</em> variable in the original dataset has 49 distinct categories ranging from traffic arrests, gambling, homicides, thefts, etc. Although the wide range of incidents provides a comprehensive and 
            exhaustive report of the day to day activites in the city, not all of these categories are related to crime. Many are just minor offenses and shouldn't be included in our analysis. For a full list of these minor incidents, 
            refer to the project notebook. After removing rows with these categories, we end up with a remaining 29 categories and <strong>dataset size of 673k</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The remaining categories are then merged into related buckets to further consolidate the data. For example, 'Larceny Thefts' and 'Stolen Property' were united into a single 'Thefts' category. Data entry errors are also handled here, 
            such as uniting 'Weapons Offense', 'Weapons Offence', and 'Weapons Carrying Etc' into 'Weapons Offense'. Furthermore, from the 'Other Miscellaneous' category, which includes many non-criminal reports, 'DUI' offenses are 
            extracted. The rest of the miscellaneous reports are discarded.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The <strong>final dataset size is 612k</strong> with 17 distinct Incident Categories. These are dubbed <strong>'Major Incidents'</strong>, and serve as the focus of the following analysis. Below is a breakdown of 'Major Incidents' and their frequencies in the dataset:
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

            <p>Figure 4. All the 'Major Incidents'</p>
        </div>

        <p class="heading">Insights</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Using the final transformed dataset of 'Major Incidents', we can begin to analyze the macro and micro crime trends in San Francisco. I set out to answer several questions. How have incident rates changed over the years? What types of incidents 
            are most common and where do they usually occur? Here are some important insights I derived using visualizations in <strong>Matplotlib.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Yearly Trends Show Decline in Incidents</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The total <strong>number of incidents yearly has been declining since 2018</strong>, with an <strong>average yearly decrease</strong> (excluding 2025) of about <strong>3.9k incidents per year</strong>. Notably, incidents reached a low of 77.1k in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
            As the pandemic continued, incidents rose through 2021 and 2022, peaking at 91.5k and then resumed its downward trend. A simple linear regression projects 75.3k incidents in 2025.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Bar chart of yearly major incident reports in San Francisco" src="../imgs/2/incidents_by_year.png">
            <p>Figure 5. Yearly Trends in the Number of Incidents.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Thefts, Vandalism, and Assaults Most Common</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            <strong>Thefts account for a staggering 41% of incidents since 2018</strong>, making it the <strong>most common offense</strong> by far. Other frequent incidents are vandalisms, assaults, burglaries, and motor vehicle thefts 
            (theft of an automobile, NOT theft from an automobile).
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Pie chart of major incident categories" src="../imgs/2/incidents_per_cat.png">
            <p>Figure 6. Proportion of Incidents by Category.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Interestingly, while thefts remain dominant, the total number of thefts per year has been decreasing. As a percentage of all incidents, 
            thefts have declined at an average rate of 2.4% per year.

        </div>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Incident Activity Not Correlated with Day of Week or Months</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            At the macro level, <strong>incidents</strong> appear to be <strong>uniformly distributed across days of the week and months of the year</strong>, showing no clear patterns. 
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Pie chart of incidents by day of the week" src="../imgs/2/days_pie.png">
            <p>Figure 9. Proportion of Incidents over Days in the Week.</p>

            <p>Figure 10. Proportion of Incidents over Months in the Year.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Three Peaks in Activity During the Day</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Incident frequency is however linked to the time of day. At a first glance, frequency seems to be nearly normally distributed around an average time of 4:48PM. 
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Histogram of incident frequency over hours in the day" src="../imgs/2/hist_incidents_hrly.png">
            <p>Figure 11. Distribution of Incidents over Hours in the Day.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            However there are several <strong>noticeable peaks</strong> in activity at <strong>12:41PM</strong> (early afternoon spike), <strong>6:07PM</strong> (evening rush), and <strong>11:54PM</strong> (late-night peak). 
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="PDF of incident density over hours in the day" src="../imgs/2/pdf_incidents_hrly.png">
            <p>Figure 12. Probability Density Function of Distribution of Incidents over Hours in the Day. (Gaussian-KDE)</p>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Incidents Largely Concentrated in Several Key Neighborhoods</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Certain neighborhoods experience consistently higher incidents than others. The five <strong>most affected areas are: Mission, Tenderloin, 
            Financial District/South Beach, South of Market (SoMa), and Bayview/Hunter's Point.</strong> Many of these areas are located in or near Downtown SF.  
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Bar graph of incident frequency by neighborhood" src="../imgs/2/incident_freq_per_year_per_neigh.png">
            <p>Figure 13. Frequency of Incidents by Neighborhood.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Furthermore, the <strong>top 10 neighborhoods account for an average of 57% of all incidents per year</strong>, and this has remained largely stable over time. However, some neighborhoods have seen significant changes. In Financial District/South Beach, 
            citywide incident percentage dropped from 10% in 2018 to 6% in 2024. The Tenderloin, in contrast, has seen an increase from 9% to 11% over the same period.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img alt="Stacked bar graph of percentage of incidents per year by neighborhood" src="../imgs/2/incidents_percent_per_yr_per_neigh.png">
            <p>Figure 14. Percentage of Incidents per Year by Neighborhood. Only top ten neighborhoods shown.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            By plotting the location of thefts, the most common incident by far, we visualize the density of thefts in the key neighborhoods listed above. Evidently, there is a <strong>clear hotspot in the city's center, near the 
            Tenderloin, Downtown, and Western Addition neighborhoods.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="heading">Future Analysis and ML</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Although we have highlighted some important discoveries through this dataset, there are still many unanwswered questions. For example, how does the distribution of incidents across neighborhoods change 
            when we calculate incidents per capita? Do certain types of incidents deviate from the overall distribution across the time of day? And many more.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The next step in this project will be preparing the dataset for machine learning models to predict incident occurences and categories. By leveraging techniques such as <strong>time series forecasting</strong> and <strong>classification models</strong>, 
            I aim to uncover deeper patterns and enhance predictive insights.
